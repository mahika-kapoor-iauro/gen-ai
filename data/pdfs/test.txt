This is a test document about artificial intelligence.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used for text analysis. Computer Vision processes images and videos. Robotics combines multiple AI techniques.
